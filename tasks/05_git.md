# Resources:
* Chacon **Pro Git**, particularly chapters 1-3 and 6
* [Github Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) and other resources at github's [help](https://help.github.com/) site
* The git cheat sheet [here](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/) (probably don't give them your email address)
* Lots of other resources all over the web

# Tasks:
Note: Unlike previous tasks, you can't easily write them as a script. However, **please do the git tasks from the command line** rather than a git GUI client.

## Git
1. Create a github account. **Let me know who you are by following my GEOL590_2017 repo on Github.** 
2. Install git on your laptop
3. Initialize a git repository (repo) in your local GEOL590_2017 folder
4. Add the script from Task 3, and push this to to your remote repo on github. (Note: I'm not concerned about the order in which you do this, I just want to see your Task 3 R script in an appropriately-named repo on github)
5. Create a branch called `dev` in your GEOL590_2017. Add a new R script that does something interesting. Add that script to the `dev` branch, make a commit, and then merge the branch into master. Push master to your github repo again.
5. Fork my repo on github for this site:[github.com/adsteen/GEOL590_2017](github.com/adsteen/GEOL590_2017). Find an error or something you think could be improved. Change it, commit the change, and issue a pull request.
6. Use git to push to your github site the code for your badplot from last week.

**From now on, part of finishing a task will be to push the code for the task to Github.**
