This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, meant to test how github displays html generated from R Notebooks. 

# Displaying plots

Here's a plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x,y=y, colour=color)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# Displaying in-line code
Here's some text, including inline code which should be the number four: `2+2`. 

# Displaying data frames

Here's a data frame:

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```
